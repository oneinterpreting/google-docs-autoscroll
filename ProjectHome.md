# Google Docs AutoScroll #


#### Summary ####
Automatically follow on-screen a Google Drive Document as it's being edited.


#### Description ####
Your screen automatically scrolls so you can continuously view what another Google Docs collaborator is typing. Unlike other auto scroll Chrome extensions that scroll at a specific speed, this one scrolls with the bottom-most line that's being entered, regardless of how fast, who it is, or how many collaborators are editing the document at the same time. The last line of text in the document will always show near the bottom of your screen so that you can see as much text above that as your monitor allows. Want to manually scroll back up for some reason? Simply uncheck the red box that is now next to the title of the document. That deactivates the extension. Click to re-check the box and you'll be auto-scrolling once again!


### Example Usage ###
  * Viewing a secretary's typing out the minutes to a meeting in real time
  * Viewing an interviewee typing coding solutions in real time during an interview.
  * Watching a dictation happen live
  * Simply typing back and forth with someone like instant messaging except you see as the other person types instead of waiting until they hit enter
