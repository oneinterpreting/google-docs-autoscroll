### How to install this extension locally for testing ###

  1. Download all the files from http://code.google.com/p/google-docs-autoscroll/source/browse/ into a folder (or git-clone it if you’d like)
  1. In Google Chrome, go to: settings->extensions-> “developer mode”
  1. Click on "load unpacked extension" and then select the folder that was generated in the first step.
  1. Open a google docs page. The extension should be active. If that doesn’t work, then just do a refresh (by pressing F5).
  1. If the extension is still not active after refreshing the page, please uninstall your version and attempt re-installation to have a fresh version for the computer to sync properly and start scrolling on any google documentation automatically for you.
